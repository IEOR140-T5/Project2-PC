Project2 Milestone 4
===========
1.  Introduction:


In actual warehouses and factories, the robots are not completely autonomous. They get instructions about where to go and what to do there form a computer that has humans supervising it. In this Milestone, we are going to use Bluetooth to communicate between the NXT Brick and PC.  

1.1. Name of the assignment, due date: 
Grid Navigation – Project 2 Milestone 5

1.2. Team 5 Members:
Phuoc Nguyen, Khoa Tran: Coders
Corey Short, Trevor Davenport: Reporters 

1.3. Approximate number of person hours spent on the project: approximately 8 hours.
1.4. Location of your project code so I can read the JavaDocs: Team 5/Project 2 – Milestone 5/

2.    Which of the performance specifications you robot meets (basic and extra credit) 

3.    Hardware design.  Describe briefly the design.   If used in previous projects, mentin modifications

4.    Experimental work  (if any):  Use charts and tables where useful

4.1. Experiment description and purpose

4.2. listing of data

4.3. Calculations and analysis 

4.4. How results were used in your code

5.    Problem analysis: (may be combined with top level software design section)

5.1.  tasks, subtasks  ( use indented format)   If possible, define tasks in terms of observable robot behavior.  Some subtasks may describe computation. 

5.1.1.           data needed and algorithms used.

5.1.2.           task sequence and repetition

6.    Software design – top level description of how your code works:  what each class does, how classes collaborate, how data flows between classes. This information should be in class header comments.  (see 7.2)

6.1. Sources of programming ideas and also classes that are used but not coded or modified for this lab  (except  NXJ classes).

6.2. Class responsibilities and how they relate to tasks and subtasks  of  5.1.  You may list the responsible class in section 5.1 instead.

6.3. For each class mention other classes used.  Which supply data? How? Which are delegated to perform subtasks?  Use  diagrams and tables where appropriate 

6.4. For complex classes, diagram the flow of data and flow of control among methods within the class, explain how methods correspond to subtasks.   The method – subtask link can be contained in 5.1 instead. 

6.5. Link to the Documentation generated from JavaDoc comments within the code as generated by Eclipse 

7.    The most interesting/challenging/difficult parts of the project
